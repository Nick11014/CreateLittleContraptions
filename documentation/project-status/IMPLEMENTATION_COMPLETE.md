# 🎉 CreateLittleContraptions - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE!

## 🏆 **PROJECT SUCCESS SUMMARY**

**MISSION ACCOMPLISHED**: Successfully resolved the invisibility issue of LittleTiles blocks when they're part of Create mod contraptions!

---

## 🎯 **PROBLEM SOLVED**

**Original Issue**: LittleTiles blocks became completely invisible during Create contraption movement, even though their data was preserved correctly.

**Root Cause**: Create's rendering pipeline didn't call LittleTiles' custom rendering system when blocks were part of moving contraptions.

**Solution**: Custom rendering integration that intercepts Create's contraption rendering and applies LittleTiles' rendering system.
