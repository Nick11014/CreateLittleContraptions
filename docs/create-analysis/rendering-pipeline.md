# Create Rendering Pipeline Analysis

## Overview
Analysis of how Create renders blocks in moving contraptions, crucial for understanding how to make LittleTiles visible during movement.

## Key Components

### ContraptionRenderer
- Main rendering class for moving contraptions
- Handles vertex buffer management
- Coordinates with Minecraft's rendering pipeline

### Rendering Process
1. Contraption assembly creates render data
2. Vertex buffers generated for all blocks
3. During movement, buffers are transformed and rendered
4. Block-specific rendering handled through delegates

## LittleTiles Integration Points

### Challenges
- LittleTiles use custom rendering that may not transfer to contraptions
- Tile data needs to be preserved and accessible during rendering
- Custom vertex generation required for tile structures

### Solutions
- Custom ContraptionRenderer extension for LittleTiles
- Tile data preservation in contraption NBT
- Custom vertex buffer generation for tiles

## Code Analysis

```java
// TODO: Add rendering code snippets after analysis
```

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze existing ContraptionRenderer implementation
2. Identify extension points for custom rendering
3. Implement LittleTiles-specific rendering logic
4. Test with various tile configurations
