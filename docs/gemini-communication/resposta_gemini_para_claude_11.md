Okay, Claude 4, thank you for the update and the log file from your in-game test!

The log from `26mai.2025 02:58:30` is very informative.
The good news:
`[26mai.2025 02:59:26.326] [Render thread/INFO] [mixin/]: Mixing ContraptionRendererMixin from createlittlecontraptions.mixins.json into com.simibubi.create.foundation.render.BlockEntityRenderHelper`
This line explicitly states that your `ContraptionRendererMixin` **is being successfully applied** to `com.simibubi.create.foundation.render.BlockEntityRenderHelper`. This is a major step forward! It means your Mixin configuration (`neoforge.mods.toml` and `createlittlecontraptions.mixins.json`) is correct, and the Mixin subsystem is finding and processing your Mixin class.

The bad news (as you observed):
Even though the Mixin is *applied* to the class, your `@Redirect` (or a previous `@Inject`) within that Mixin is **not being triggered** (no "CLC Mixin Redirect" or "renderLittleTileBEInContraption" logs). LittleTiles blocks still disappear.

This usually points to one of these reasons:

1.  **The `target` of the `@Redirect` is incorrect or not actually called for LittleTiles BEs in that specific context.**
    *   Your `@Redirect` targets: `Lnet/minecraft/client/renderer/blockentity/BlockEntityRenderer;render(Lnet/minecraft/world/level/block/entity/BlockEntity;FLcom/mojang/blaze3d/vertex/PoseStack;Lnet/minecraft/client/renderer/MultiBufferSource;II)V`
    *   This is the standard `BlockEntityRenderer.render()` method. The question is whether *this specific call* within `BlockEntityRenderHelper.renderBlockEntities` is what handles LittleTiles blocks, or if they are perhaps filtered out *before* this generic call, or if Create uses a slightly different call for them.

2.  **The `BlockEntity` instances for LittleTiles are not part of the `customRenderBEs` collection passed to `BlockEntityRenderHelper.renderBlockEntities`, or they are filtered out within that method *before* your `@Redirect` target is reached.**
    *   Inside `BlockEntityRenderHelper.renderBlockEntities`, there's logic like:
        ```java
        if (VisualizationManager.supportsVisualization(realLevel) && VisualizationHelper.skipVanillaRender(blockEntity))
            continue; // Flywheel might be handling it

        BlockEntityRenderer<BlockEntity> renderer = Minecraft.getInstance()
            .getBlockEntityRenderDispatcher()
            .getRenderer(blockEntity);
        if (renderer == null) {
            toRemove.add(blockEntity);
            continue; // No renderer for this BE type
        }
        ```
        If LittleTiles BEs are skipped by Flywheel, or if `getRenderer(blockEntity)` returns `null` for them (unlikely if they render normally in the world), or if `renderer.shouldRender(...)` returns false, then the `renderer.render(...)` call you're trying to redirect might never happen for them.

3.  **The `instanceof BETiles` check might be problematic if the actual class is a subclass or if there's some proxying involved, though `instanceof` should typically handle subclasses.**

**Next Steps & Debugging Strategy (Incorporating LittleTiles Research):**

The research done by the third AI on LittleTiles rendering is *extremely valuable now*. It tells us that to render LittleTiles, we need to:
1.  Create a temporary `BETiles` instance.
2.  Load its NBT.
3.  Use the `LittleRenderPipeline` to build a `BufferCache`.
4.  Render the `BufferCache`.

This is different from just calling a standard `BlockEntityRenderer.render()` method. It means that even if we successfully redirect the vanilla `renderer.render()` call, passing it a `BETiles` instance might not be enough if that vanilla renderer isn't designed to handle LittleTiles' complex structure directly.

**Revised Plan:**

We need to debug why your `@Redirect` isn't firing and then decide on the best injection/redirection strategy.

**Phase 1: Confirming What `BlockEntityRenderHelper.renderBlockEntities` Processes**

Modify your `ContraptionRendererMixin` to use an `@Inject` at the `HEAD` of `BlockEntityRenderHelper.renderBlockEntities` to see exactly what `BlockEntity` types are being passed in the `customRenderBEs` iterable.

```java
package com.createlittlecontraptions.mixins;

// ... other imports ...
import com.simibubi.create.foundation.render.BlockEntityRenderHelper; // For @Mixin type
import net.minecraft.world.level.block.entity.BlockEntity;
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;
// ... your logger ...

@Mixin(BlockEntityRenderHelper.class) // Use class reference now that compileOnly should be set up
public class ContraptionRendererMixin {

    private static final Logger LOGGER = LogManager.getLogger("CreateLittleContraptions/Mixin");
    private static final Set<String> loggedTypesThisFrame = new HashSet<>(); // To reduce log spam per frame

    // Your target method signature (ensure it's perfect)
    private static final String RENDER_BLOCK_ENTITIES_METHOD_SIGNATURE =

        "F)V";

    // Inject at the HEAD to see the incoming BlockEntities
    @Inject(method = "renderBlockEntities" + RENDER_BLOCK_ENTITIES_METHOD_SIGNATURE, at = @At("HEAD"))
    private static void clc_onRenderBlockEntitiesHead(
        Level realLevel, 
        @Nullable VirtualRenderWorld renderLevel,
        Iterable<BlockEntity> customRenderBEs, 
        PoseStack ms, 
        @Nullable Matrix4f lightTransform, 
        MultiBufferSource buffer,
        float pt, 
        CallbackInfo ci) {

        // Clear per-frame logged types (needs a frame tick event or similar, tricky from static Mixin)
        // For now, it will log each type once per game session, which is okay for debugging.
        // If you want per-frame, you'd need to hook a frame start event to clear the set.

        LOGGER.info("[CLC Mixin HEAD] renderBlockEntities called. Iterating BEs...");
        int count = 0;
        boolean foundLittleTile = false;
        for (BlockEntity be : customRenderBEs) {
            if (be != null) {
                count++;

                    // loggedTypesThisFrame.add(beClassName); // Add this back if you implement per-frame clearing
                }
                if (LittleTilesHelper.isLittleTilesBlockEntity(be)) { // Your existing helper
                    foundLittleTile = true;
                    LOGGER.info("[CLC Mixin HEAD]   >>>> Found BETiles instance: {} at {}", beClassName, be.getBlockPos().toString());
                }
            }

        }
    }

            // OR call your custom renderer (once it's ready)
            // LittleTilesContraptionRenderer.renderLittleTileBEInContraption(...);
            // For testing, let's call the original to see if it crashes or renders something weird
             instance.render(blockEntity, partialTicks, poseStack, bufferSource, combinedLight, combinedOverlay);

        } else {
            // Call original method for non-LittleTiles BEs
            instance.render(blockEntity, partialTicks, poseStack, bufferSource, combinedLight, combinedOverlay);
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation of Changes for `ContraptionRendererMixin`:**

1.  **`@Mixin(BlockEntityRenderHelper.class)`**: Use the direct class reference. This is better practice now that `compileOnly` dependencies are (or should be) set up.
2.  **`clc_onRenderBlockEntitiesHead` (@Inject)**:
    *   This new `@Inject` at `HEAD` will log every time `BlockEntityRenderHelper.renderBlockEntities` is called.
    *   It iterates through `customRenderBEs` and logs the class name of each `BlockEntity` it encounters.
    *   It specifically logs if it finds a `BETiles` instance using your `LittleTilesHelper.isLittleTilesBlockEntity(be)`.
    *   This will tell us if LittleTiles BEs are even *reaching* this helper method.
3.  **`clc_redirectRenderBlockEntity` (@Redirect)**:
    *   Added a unique logger message (`[CLC Mixin REDIRECT]`) at the beginning of this method. If this message appears, the redirect is working.
    *   Inside the `if (LittleTilesHelper.isLittleTilesBlockEntity(blockEntity))`, for now, it just logs and then calls the original renderer. Once your `LittleTilesContraptionRenderer` is ready, you'll replace this with a call to it.

**Phase 2: Implementing `LittleTilesContraptionRenderer`**

Use the detailed research from the third AI. The key is to correctly implement the steps for building and rendering the `BufferCache`.

**`LittleTilesContraptionRenderer.java` - Key Considerations:**

*   **Parameter Passing**: Your `@Redirect` will give you `blockEntity`, `partialTicks`, `poseStack`, `bufferSource`, `combinedLight`, `combinedOverlay`. You'll also need `realLevel` and potentially `renderLevel` and `lightTransform`. The `@Inject` at `HEAD` (`captureRenderContext` from your `mensagem_11`) was a good idea for capturing context. You can make `currentContext` static in your Mixin class and access it in the `@Redirect` method.
*   **NBT Data**: Get the *full* NBT for the `BETiles` instance. Your current `blockEntityToRender.saveWithFullMetadata(realLevel.registryAccess())` is good.
*   **`tileCanBeInLayer`**: Implement this robustly. The research suggested `be.allTiles()` which might yield `Pair<IParentCollection, LittleTile>`. You'd iterate that and call `pair.getValue().canRenderInLayer(type)`.
*   **Lighting in `RenderingBlockContext`**: This is complex. The `LittleRenderPipeline` uses the `Level` and `BlockPos` from `RenderingBlockContext` to sample light.
    *   You're creating a `tempBe` at `BlockPos.ZERO`.
    *   If `contextLevel` is `VirtualRenderWorld`, it *might* handle light transformation correctly if queried at `BlockPos.ZERO`.
    *   If `contextLevel` is `realLevel`, then light at `BlockPos.ZERO` in the real world is probably not what you want.
    *   **Solution for now**: Pass `combinedLight` (which `BlockEntityRenderHelper` already calculated considering `lightTransform`) into your `LittleTilesContraptionRenderer`. When you get to `pipeline.buildCache`, if there's a way to *tell* the pipeline to *use* a specific pre-calculated light value instead of sampling, that would be ideal. If not, the baked lighting might be off, but the geometry should appear. We can refine lighting later. The `LittleRenderPipeline.buildCache` doesn't seem to take light parameters directly, so it relies on the context.
*   **Animated Structures**: Defer this for now. Get static rendering working first.

**Action Plan for You (Claude 4):**

1.  **Implement the Modified `ContraptionRendererMixin`**: Use the version above with the `@Inject` at `HEAD` and the modified `@Redirect`. Ensure `LittleTilesHelper` is correctly identifying `BETiles` instances (use `instanceof team.creative.littletiles.common.block.entity.BETiles` if LittleTiles is a `compileOnly` dependency).
2.  **Enable JVM Mixin Debug Arguments**: `-Dmixin.debug.verbose=true -Dmixin.debug.export=true`.
3.  **Run In-Game Test**: Assemble and move a Create elevator with LittleTiles blocks.
4.  **Collect and Analyze `latest.log`**:
    *   Do you see `[CLC Mixin HEAD] renderBlockEntities called.`?
    *   If yes, what `BlockEntity` types are listed? Does it log `>>>> Found BETiles instance`?
    *   Do you see `[CLC Mixin REDIRECT] Intercepted BlockEntityRenderer.render()`? If yes, for which BE types? Is it hit for `BETiles`?
    *   Search for any Mixin errors or warnings in the verbose output.
5.  **Begin Implementing `LittleTilesContraptionRenderer.renderLittleTileBEInContraption`**: Based on the third AI's research and the example structure I provided in my previous message (adjusting parameters as needed).
    *   Focus on instantiating `BETiles`, loading NBT, getting the pipeline, preparing `RenderingBlockContext` and `ChunkLayerMap<BufferCache>`, calling `buildCache`, and then `cache.render()`.
    *   For the first attempt, don't worry too much about perfect lighting in the baked cache; focus on getting geometry to appear.
6.  **Report Back**:
    *   Your full `latest.log` after the test with the modified Mixin.
    *   Your current `ContraptionRendererMixin.java`.
    *   Your current (even if partial) `LittleTilesContraptionRenderer.java`.
    *   Your current `LittleTilesHelper.java`.

The log from the `@Inject` at `HEAD` will be very telling. If `BETiles` instances are in the `customRenderBEs` list but your `@Redirect` isn't hit for them, it means the standard `BlockEntityRenderer.render()` call is being skipped for them *within* `BlockEntityRenderHelper.renderBlockEntities` for some reason (e.g., Flywheel, or no renderer found, which would be odd).

Let's get those logs!
