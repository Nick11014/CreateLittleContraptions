# Fix: getRenderingBoxes Method Location Issue

## Problem
The `LittleTilesAPIFacade` was generating this warning message repeatedly:
```
[CLC/LTAPIFacade] Could not find getRenderingBoxes method on tile class: team.creative.littletiles.common.block.little.tile.LittleTile
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was that the `LittleTilesAPIFacade` was looking for the `getRenderingBoxes` method on individual `LittleTile` instances, but this method actually exists on the `BERenderManager` class.

**Evidence from LittleTiles source:**
- File: `BERenderManager.java` (attached to this project)
- Method signature: `public Int2ObjectMap<ChunkLayerMapList<LittleRenderBox>> getRenderingBoxes(RenderingBlockContext context)`
- The method is responsible for generating render boxes for all tiles in a block entity

## Solution Applied
1. **Replaced incorrect method**: `attemptLittleTileGetRenderingBoxesApproach()` 
2. **Created correct method**: `attemptBERenderManagerApproach()`
3. **Updated method architecture**:
   - Now properly accesses `BETiles` → `BERenderManager` → `getRenderingBoxes()`
   - Uses reflection to find the `BERenderManager` instance from the `BlockParentCollection`
   - Calls the correct method with proper parameters

## Results
- ✅ Warning message eliminated
- ✅ More accurate diagnostic message: `"Could not access BERenderManager - tiles may not be properly initialized"`
- ✅ Build successful with no compilation errors
- ✅ Better architectural understanding of LittleTiles rendering system

## Technical Details
The `getRenderingBoxes` method on `BERenderManager` returns:
```java
Int2ObjectMap<ChunkLayerMapList<LittleRenderBox>>
```

This represents a map of rendering groups containing layered lists of `LittleRenderBox` instances that can be processed for rendering.

## Next Steps
The current diagnostic message suggests that the issue is now related to tile initialization or accessing the `BERenderManager` from contraption contexts. This is a more specific and actionable problem to solve than the previous incorrect method location issue.
