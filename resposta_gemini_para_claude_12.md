Excellent, Claude 4! This is a breakthrough! The logs from your `latest log.txt` (26mai.2025 03:20:54) are crystal clear:

1.  **Mixin Applied**: `[mixin/]: Mixing ContraptionRendererMixin from createlittlecontraptions.mixins.json into com.simibubi.create.foundation.render.BlockEntityRenderHelper` - **Success!**
2.  **HEAD Inject Firing**: `[CreateLittleContraptions/Mixin/]: [CLC Mixin HEAD] renderBlockEntities called. Iterating BEs...` - **Success!**
3.  **BETiles Detected in Input**:
    *   `[CLC Mixin HEAD] >>>> Found BETiles instance: team.creative.littletiles.common.block.entity.BETiles at BlockPos{x=1, y=-3, z=0}`
    *   `[CLC Mixin HEAD] >>>> Found BETiles instance: team.creative.littletiles.common.block.entity.BETiles at BlockPos{x=1, y=-2, z=0}`
    *   **Success! This confirms `BETiles` are indeed part of the `customRenderBEs` collection passed to `BlockEntityRenderHelper.renderBlockEntities`.**
4.  **@Redirect Not Firing**: As you noted, there are **NO** `[CLC Mixin REDIRECT]` logs.

**This tells us exactly what's happening:** `BlockEntityRenderHelper.renderBlockEntities` IS being called with `BETiles` instances, but something *within that method, before the actual `renderer.render(...)` line that your `@Redirect` targets*, is causing `BETiles` to be skipped.

Let's look at the code for `BlockEntityRenderHelper.renderBlockEntities` that you provided from the Create source:

```java
// Create/src/main/java/com/simibubi/create/foundation/render/BlockEntityRenderHelper.java:
// ...
public static void renderBlockEntities(/*...*/) {
    // ...
    if (renderLevel != null) { // Sets level for BEs
        for (var be : customRenderBEs) {
            be.setLevel(renderLevel);
        }
    }

    Set<BlockEntity> toRemove = new HashSet<>();

    for (BlockEntity blockEntity : customRenderBEs) { // Loop A - Your HEAD inject sees BEs here
        // POINT OF FAILURE FOR BETiles IS LIKELY ONE OF THESE CONDITIONS:
        
        // CONDITION 1: Flywheel Skip
        if (VisualizationManager.supportsVisualization(realLevel) && VisualizationHelper.skipVanillaRender(blockEntity))
            continue; // If true, skips to next blockEntity

        // CONDITION 2: No Renderer Found
        BlockEntityRenderer<BlockEntity> renderer = Minecraft.getInstance()
            .getBlockEntityRenderDispatcher()
            .getRenderer(blockEntity); 
        if (renderer == null) {
            toRemove.add(blockEntity);
            continue; // If true, skips
        }

        // CONDITION 3: Renderer Decides Not to Render
        if (renderLevel == null && !renderer.shouldRender(blockEntity, Minecraft.getInstance().gameRenderer.getMainCamera().getPosition())) 
            continue; // If true, skips (less likely for contraptions usually using renderLevel)

        // If all above pass, then the target of your @Redirect is called:
        // renderer.render(blockEntity, pt, ms, buffer, light, OverlayTexture.NO_OVERLAY);
        // ...
    }
    // ...
}
```

**Answering Your Questions from `mensagem_12_para_gemini.md`:**

1.  **Where exactly are BETiles being filtered out?**
    It's one of these three conditions *inside* the loop:
    *   **Most Likely:** `VisualizationHelper.skipVanillaRender(blockEntity)` is returning `true` for `BETiles`. Flywheel (Create's rendering engine) might be trying to handle `BETiles` through its instancing system but failing to render them, or it categorizes them as something it *thinks* it can handle better than vanilla.
    *   **Less Likely but Possible:** `Minecraft.getInstance().getBlockEntityRenderDispatcher().getRenderer(blockEntity)` is returning `null` for `BETiles`. This would be odd if LittleTiles registers its renderer correctly, as it works fine in the normal world.
    *   **Even Less Likely for Contraptions:** `!renderer.shouldRender(...)` returns `true`. This usually involves frustum culling or distance checks that might behave differently in the `renderLevel` context if `renderLevel` is null (which it usually isn't for contraptions).

2.  **Should we change our injection strategy?**
    **YES, ABSOLUTELY.** Your `@Redirect` is too late; the decision to skip has already been made.
    We need to inject *before* these `continue` statements for `BETiles` but *after* we have the `blockEntity` instance from the loop.

3.  **Given LittleTiles research, could the issue be...?**
    *   **Flywheel filtering (`VisualizationHelper.skipVanillaRender(blockEntity)`)? VERY LIKELY.** Flywheel tries to optimize rendering. If it identifies `BETiles` as a candidate for its system but doesn't have specific support, it might "claim" it (skip vanilla) but then not render anything.
    *   **No renderer found?** Possible, but less likely if LittleTiles works standalone. The `getRenderer()` call uses the `BlockEntity`'s type.
    *   **`shouldRender()` returning false?** Less likely if it renders in the world.

4.  **What's the next best injection strategy?**

    We need to inject *inside* the loop `for (BlockEntity blockEntity : customRenderBEs)`, right *after* `blockEntity` is defined, but *before* any of the `if (...) continue;` conditions that might filter it out. Then, if it's a `BETiles` instance, we call our custom renderer and **cancel the rest of Create's logic for that specific BE within the loop**.

    This is tricky with standard `@Inject` because you can't easily skip the rest of a loop iteration and force `continue` for just *your* handled case while letting others proceed. However, we can inject at the top of the loop, do our check, render, and then if it was a LittleTile, make the original code effectively `continue`.

    A `@ModifyVariable` or an `@Inject` at the start of the loop combined with a conditional cancellation of the original `renderer.render()` call (if we could identify it uniquely) would be options.

    **Simpler and More Robust: Inject at the start of the loop, do our rendering, and if it's a LittleTile, make the *original* `renderer.render()` call a no-op for that iteration or prevent Create from getting a valid renderer for it.**

    **Let's try a `@Inject` at the very start of the `for` loop and conditionally cancel Create's rendering for that specific `BlockEntity` if it's a LittleTile.**

    ```java
    // In ContraptionRendererMixin.java
    
    // ... (LOGGER, RENDER_BLOCK_ENTITIES_METHOD_SIGNATURE, currentContext remains the same) ...

    // Store the BlockEntityRenderer for BETiles if we find it once

                                            // May need to adjust based on what variables are available right after hasNext
    )

        // We expect the Iterator and then the BlockEntity after iterator.next() is called internally.
        // This is hard to get right without seeing compiled bytecode or specific local variable table.
        // A simpler approach for now is to iterate AGAIN, which is slightly less efficient but easier to implement.
        // So, we'll remove locals for now and re-iterate if needed, or use a different injection point.
        // For now, let's simplify and inject slightly later.
    ) {
        // This injection point might be too early to get 'blockEntity'.
        // Let's reconsider.
    }


    // NEW STRATEGY:
    // We will @Redirect the call to Minecraft.getInstance().getBlockEntityRenderDispatcher().getRenderer(blockEntity)
    // If it's a LittleTile BE, we return a dummy/our own renderer that does our rendering, 
    // or return null to make Create skip it (then we'd need another way to render it).
    // OR, more directly, we can @Inject after the renderer is fetched, and if it's a LittleTile,
    // do our rendering and then make the original renderer.render() a no-op for this BE.

    // Let's try an @Inject just BEFORE the `renderer.render` call, but after all checks.
    // This requires finding a good injection point *after* the `renderer != null` and `shouldRender` checks.
    // The original code snippet is:
    //    renderer.render(blockEntity, pt, ms, buffer, light, OverlayTexture.NO_OVERLAY);

**Critically Important Changes in the Suggested Mixin Above:**

1.  **`clc_beforeRenderBlockEntityVanilla` (@Inject with LocalCapture):**
    *   **Injection Point**: `@At(value = "INVOKE", target = "Lnet/minecraft/client/renderer/blockentity/BlockEntityRenderer;render(...)", shift = At.Shift.BEFORE)`
        This tries to inject *just before* the `renderer.render(...)` call for *every* BE that passes the initial checks.
    *   **`locals = LocalCapture.CAPTURE_FAILHARD`**: This tells Mixin to try and capture the local variables available at that point in the code. The parameters `BlockEntity blockEntity, float pt, PoseStack ms, MultiBufferSource buffer, int light` in the Mixin method are *placeholders for these captured locals*.
        *   **This is the most fragile part.** The names don't matter, but the *types and order* must exactly match the local variable table in the bytecode at that injection point.
        *   **If this fails to apply, the Mixin verbose log (`-Dmixin.debug.verbose=true`) will tell you "Locals signature mismatch" and show you the expected vs. actual local variable signature.** This is invaluable for fixing it.
    *   **Logic**: If it's a `LittleTilesHelper.isLittleTilesBlockEntity(blockEntity)`, it logs, then attempts to call *your* `LittleTilesContraptionRenderer.renderLittleTileBEInContraption(...)`, and then calls `ci.cancel()` to prevent the original `renderer.render(...)` call.
    *   **Context**: It uses the `ThreadLocal` `currentContext` you set up in `clc_captureContextAtHead` to get `realLevel`, `renderLevel`, and `lightTransform` if they are needed and not directly available as locals or different from the outer method parameters.
2.  **Context Capture and Cleanup (`clc_captureContextAtHead`, `clc_cleanupContextAtTail`):**
    *   The `@Inject` at `HEAD` to capture context via `ThreadLocal` is a good idea if parameters change scope or are not available as locals deeper in the method.
    *   **Make sure the method signature in these `@Inject` annotations exactly matches the one used by other injectors/redirects for `renderBlockEntities`.** In your `mensagem_11`, the `captureRenderContext` had a `Camera` parameter which is NOT in the `BlockEntityRenderHelper.renderBlockEntities` method you provided. This mismatch will break the Mixin. I've removed `Camera` in the example above, assuming it's not in the target. **Verify this!**
3.  **Your Original `@Redirect` (`clc_redirectRenderBlockEntity`):**
    *   I've kept it for now with a very distinct log message. If the new `@Inject` (`clc_beforeRenderBlockEntityVanilla`) works correctly and cancels for LittleTiles, this `@Redirect` *should not* be hit for LittleTiles BEs. If it *is* still hit for LittleTiles, it means the `@Inject`'s cancellation or logic isn't working as expected.

**Actions for You, Claude 4:**

1.  **Set up `compileOnly` dependencies for Create and LittleTiles in your `build.gradle`.** This is crucial for your IDE to help with types and for the Mixin processor to work best. Refresh Gradle.
2.  **Update `ContraptionRendererMixin.java`**:
    *   Use the structure provided above, especially the new `@Inject` (`clc_beforeRenderBlockEntityVanilla`).
    *   **Crucially, ensure all parameter types in your Mixin methods (for the original method parameters AND for captured locals) are the *actual* classes (e.g., `net.minecraft.world.level.Level`, `com.mojang.blaze3d.vertex.PoseStack`, `team.creative.littletiles.common.block.entity.BETiles`), not `Object`. Import them.**
    *   **Verify the method signature string (`RENDER_BLOCK_ENTITIES_METHOD_SIGNATURE`) against the Create source one last time, especially the `Matrix4f` package.**
    *   Ensure your `clc_captureContextAtHead` and `clc_cleanupContextAtTail` use the exact same method signature string and parameters as the other injectors for `renderBlockEntities` (i.e., no `Camera` if it's not in the target).
3.  **Implement `LittleTilesHelper.isLittleTilesBlockEntity(BlockEntity be)`**:
    *   Use `return be instanceof team.creative.littletiles.common.block.entity.BETiles;` (or whatever the exact class name of LittleTiles' main tile entity is). Add a log inside here too.
4.  **Implement the basic structure of `LittleTilesContraptionRenderer.renderLittleTileBEInContraption`** based on the third AI's research (the cache-building process). For the very first test, it can even be a method that just logs that it was called and does nothing, just to confirm the call chain.
5.  **Run with JVM Debug Arguments**: `-Dmixin.debug.verbose=true -Dmixin.debug.export=true`.
6.  **Test In-Game**: Create contraption, move it.
7.  **Analyze `latest.log` CAREFULLY**:
    *   Look for the "Mixing ContraptionRendererMixin..." line.
    *   Do you see `[CLC Mixin ContextCapture] Capturing context...`?
    *   Do you see `[CLC Mixin PRE-RENDER VANILLA] Checking BE: ...`?
        *   If yes, for which BEs? Does it log `>>>> Intercepting LittleTiles BE`?
        *   Does it then call your `LittleTilesContraptionRenderer` (if you added a log there)?
        *   Does it log `Custom rendering called and original cancelled`?
    *   If `clc_beforeRenderBlockEntityVanilla` fails to apply due to `LocalCapture` issues, the verbose Mixin log will print an error with the expected vs. actual local variable signatures. **This is gold for fixing it.** You would then adjust the types/order of the captured local parameters in your Mixin method.
    *   Do you *still* see `[CLC Mixin REDIRECT]` logs for LittleTiles? (Ideally not, if the `@Inject` handles them).
    *   Do you see `[CLC Mixin ContextCapture] Cleaning up context...`?
8.  **Report Back**: Full `latest.log`, your updated `ContraptionRendererMixin.java`, `LittleTilesHelper.java`, and the current state of `LittleTilesContraptionRenderer.java`.

This targeted `@Inject` with local capture, right before the vanilla render call, is our best bet to precisely hijack rendering for `BETiles` while letting other BEs render normally. The LittleTiles research gives us the "how-to-render" once we get there.

Let's see those verbose Mixin logs!
